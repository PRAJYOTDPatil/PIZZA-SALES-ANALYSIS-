🚀 **Unveiling My New Power BI Dashboard: Pizza Sales Analysis 🍕📊**  


I'm excited to share a recent project where I designed an interactive **Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard** using **Power BI**. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for business growth. Here's what the dashboard reveals:  

✅ **Sales Trends**: Track daily, weekly, and monthly pizza sales.  
✅ **Top-Selling Pizzas**: Identify customer favorites to boost marketing efforts.  
✅ **Revenue Breakdown**: Analyze sales by pizza type, size, and toppings.  
✅ ** Insights**: Understand which locations perform best and why.  


With visually compelling graphs, slicers, and KPIs, this dashboard empowers decision-makers to optimize operations and increase revenue.  

🌟 **Key Features**:
- Interactive filters for real-time insights.  
- Heatmaps to highlight high-performing regions.  
- Pie charts (pun intended 😉) for pizza type comparison.  

Feel free to check out the dashboard in the comments and let me know your thoughts! 📥  
I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. 🙌
